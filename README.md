# scrolless

A Safari browser extension that makes paging down scroll a little less.

## Why

On some sites there are overlays at the top or bottom of the window which cause
paging down to scroll some of the next page's content underneath the overlay. I'm 
looking at you NYTimes and SF Chronicle. Then after page down I'd have to 
manually scroll back up a couple lines.

## Installation

To install, [download the extension](https://github.com/kevinoliver/scrolless/releases) and then run the app. 
I haven't dealt with code signing (read as: paid for an Apple developer account) so you need to 
turn on Developer mode in Safari and then [allow running of unsigned extensions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_web_extensions/running_your_safari_web_extension#3744467).
You may also need to enable the extension in `Preferencesâ€¦ > Extensions` and allow it to access all websites.

While this is a Safari browser extension I'm pretty sure that it'd work with Chrome, Firefox, or any other browser supporting the [WebExtensions API](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/about-the-webextensions-api/). See the files in [`Scolless Extension/Resources/`](Scolless%20Extension/Resources/).

## Usage

The sites and amount to scroll are hard-coded in [`content.js`](Scolless%20Extension/Resources/content.js).
